## Case Study #4: Data Bank

### Business Task
Danny launched a new initiative, Data Bank which runs just like any other digital bank - but it isn‚Äôt only for banking activities, they also have the world‚Äôs most secure distributed data storage platform!

Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts. There are a few interesting caveats that go with this business model, and this is where the Data Bank team need your help!

The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need.

This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!

### Business Task
Data Mart is an online supermarket that specialises in fresh produce.

In June 2020, large scale supply changes were made at Data Mart. All Data Mart products now use sustainable packaging methods in every single step from the farm all the way to the customer.

Danny needs your help to analyse and quantify the impact of this change on the sales performance for Data Mart and it‚Äôs separate business areas.

The key business question to answer are the following:
- What was the quantifiable impact of the changes introduced in June 2020?
- Which platform, region, segment and customer types were the most impacted by this change?
- What can we do about future introduction of similar sustainability updates to the business to minimise impact on sales?

Here are some further details about the dataset:

1. Data Mart has international operations using a multi-`region` strategy.
2. Data Mart has both, a retail and online `platform` in the form of a Shopify store front to serve their customers.
3. Customer `segment` and `customer_type` data relates to personal age and demographics information that is shared with Data Mart.
4. `transactions` is the count of unique purchases made through Data Mart and `sales` is the actual dollar amount of purchases.

Each record in the dataset is related to a specific aggregated slice of the underlying sales data rolled up into a week_date value which represents the start of the sales week.
